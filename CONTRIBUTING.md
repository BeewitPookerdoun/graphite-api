Contributions to Graphite-API are welcome! Before you start, here are a couple
of indications:

* If you want to report a bug, please search in the existing issues to see if
  the bug has already been reported.

* If you want to write a patch, make sure there is no pending pull request for
  the same thing to avoid duplicate efforts.

* If you're fixing a bug, please add a regression test that reproduces the
  bug and proves your fix is actually working.

Pull requests must pass the travis builds to get merged. Please validate that
your code passes flake8 checks and that the documentation builds without
warnings.
